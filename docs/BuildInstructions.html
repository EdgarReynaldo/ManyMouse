<title>Build instructions for ManyMouse</title></head>



<body><p>
These are the build instructions for the ManyMouse project.<br>
<br>
You will need a C++ compiler, Allegro 5.1.10 or a later version, and
Windows XP or a later version Windows OS to build ManyMouse. Versions
of Windows prior to XP do not have support for the RawInput API, which
is needed for most of ManyMouse's functionality.<br>
<br>
ManyMouse has been successfully built on Windows Vista using MinGW 4.8.1 and Allegro 5.1.10. Any modern C++ compiler should do.

<h3><u>Libraries necessary to build ManyMouse</u></h3>
<p>
ManyMouse depends on the Allegro 5 Library for windowing, graphics, and
some input. Allegro 5 in turn depends on several optional libraries.
One of them is FreeType. Allegro uses FreeType to render ttf fonts,
which we use in our application, so Allegro needs to be built with
FreeType support. ManyMouse is currently using Allegro's DirectX
backend to render its windows, so DX for MinGW is needed as well.<br>
</p><p>Allegro 5.2 is the oldest release that works with ManyMouse, and is the most current as well.</p><p>
You can find binaries for Allegro 5 at allegro.cc, on the files page (NOTE: Don't use these, they are outdated) :<br>

</a><br>
<br>
Alternatively you can build using MinGW. I provide an unofficial binary
distribution of MinGW 4.8.1 on my Sourceforge account. Since Allegro
does not yet have binaries for the MinGW 4.8.1 compiler, you will
either need to build it yourself, or else you can use binaries for
Allegro 5.2 for MinGW 4.8.1 which I provide as well.<br>

<br>
The distros are in .7z format, which means you need 7-zip to decompress them. You can download 7-zip for free at their website :<br>

</p><h3><u>Installing MinGW</u></h3>
To install mingw all you need to do is extract the contents of the
mingw_4_8_1-4.tar.7z file twice. This will create a mingw_4_8_1-4
directory, which you can rename as you like.<br>
<br>
To install the DirectX package, simply extract dx9mgw.zip over your new mingw folder, overwriting files as necessary.<br>
<br>
I use CodeBlocks with MinGW so the installation directions that follow
are for CB and MinGW. To configure CodeBlocks to use the new compiler
go to Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Compiler and select the Toolchain
Executables tab. Click on the ... button next to the auto-detect button
and navigate to your new mingw folder. Select it and say okay. CB
should detect everything okay at which point you can compile with MinGW.<br>
<br>
Alternatively you can compile with MinGW from the command line. To do
this you need to add the mingw\bin folder to your PATH environment
variable. You can either add it to your global environment variables
using the advanced system settings under the system control panel
(which is not recommended), or by manually setting it from the command
line. The correct command to add MinGW to your path is :<br>
<br>
set PATH=$MINGDIR$\bin;%PATH%<br>
<br>
where $MINGDIR$ is the full path to your base mingw folder. If you do
this from the command line, any changes to the path you make will be
discarded once you exit the terminal, as they are local to the terminal
instance. For this reason, many prefer to create a batch file to open a
new terminal and add mingw to the path. Please note the semicolon
between the mingw directory and the reference to the PATH environment
variable. This is necessary to separate the search directories on the
path.<br>
<br>
<h3><u>Installing Allegro 5</u></h3>
Next we need to extract the Allegro 5 binary package. As before,
extract twice to your target directory and it will create a new folder
named A5GITdistro with several sub folders. The important ones for us
are the include, lib, and bin directories.<br>
<br>
ManyMouse comes with a CB project already set up, but it requires you
to copy the A5GITdistro folder to the ManyMouse root folder. Otherwise
you can set up your own project to build ManyMouse. The following
instructions detail how to accomplish this.<br>
<br>
<h4><u>Creating a new CB project to build ManyMouse.</u></h4>
First set up a new CodeBlocks project. Goto
Menu-&gt;File-&gt;New-&gt;Project and create a new Empty Project in the
ManyMouse root folder. Once the project is created, go to
Project-&gt;Add Files and add all the files in the src folder to the
project. Once you have it set up the way you want we can configure the
project to include and link to the Allegro libraries.<br>
<br>
The next step is to setup your project's compiler and linker search
directories to include A5110distro\include and A5110distro\lib
respectively. These can both be accessed from
Menu-&gt;Project-&gt;Build Options under the Search directories tab.<br>
<br>
Once that is complete you need to add the desired allegro libraries to
your linker commands. Go to Menu-&gt;Project-&gt;Build Options and
select the Linker Settings tab. For now, link to
liballegro_monolith-debug.dll.a or liballegro_monolith.dll.a by adding
the appropriate one to either 'Additional Link Libraries' on the left,
or linker options on the right. The correct linker options for MinGW
and the allegro libraries are '-lallegro_monolith.dll' or
'-lallegro_monolith-debug.dll'. The -l tells the compiler to link to
the library specified right after it. The format is -lNAME where the
library's full name is libNAME.a. -l is simply a shortcut.
