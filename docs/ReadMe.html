<h3>Required APIs</h3>
ManyMouse depends on the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645543%28VS.85%29.aspx">RawInput API for Windows</a> as well as the <a href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net">Allegro 5 graphics library</a>. The RawInput API allows an application to receive raw input from hid compliant devices such as keyboards and mice. Allegro 5 allows you to create and draw to a window as well as load images and draw graphics and more.<br/>
